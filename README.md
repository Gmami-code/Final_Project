# Final Project
My idea for this final project is a text-based adventure game. When you first brought up the project and were pitching your ideas to the class, I chose making a game as my first option. I wanted to do something different instead of your normal average tic tac toe, chess, checkers, or connect 4 games so, I came up with the text-based adventure game. I came up with this idea from another class I’m in, Intro To Creative Writing. I’m supposed to write a creative nonfiction piece and I was approved to do it in the style of a choose your own adventure. Basically the author sets the scene on the first page and then at the bottom of the page it says, “Go to page _ for ____ (this)” and “Got to page _ for ____ (that)”. It was a way for the author to keep the reader engaged by having the chapter(s) in the book be interactive / shape the story they’re trying to tell based on the reader’s preferences and decisions. It was basically like a game to the author and reader. I then thought about this concept and connected the dots back to this class, then BOOM! I think I plan to put it in the format as “Choose the right path for ____ (this)” and “Choose the left path for ____ (that)” and then the player has to go through the right paths (plural) to reach victory, if not they lose and have the option to start all over.
