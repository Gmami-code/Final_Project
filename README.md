# Final Project
My idea for this final project is a text-based adventure game. I think I plan to put it in the format as “Choose the right path for ____ (this)” and “Choose the left path for ____ (that)” and then the player has to go through the right paths (plural) to reach victory, if not they lose and have the option to start all over.
